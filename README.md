# pgswift

A PostgreSQL driver for use in swift. Requires Swift 5.0+. Depends on libpq, but package manager knows about that.

Every other driver I've seen requires someone's generic database interface, generally an ORM system. I just want raw calls to postgresql.

## Documentation

Generated using [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy). It uses Ruby, so I'd highly recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) instead of the system Ruby since the syystem Ruby is old and being removed in the future.  And you'd have to use sudo to intall in system directories.
